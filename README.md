# Home Library Service

## Prerequisites

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

## Downloading

```
git clone https://github.com/Intrstng/nodejs2024Q3-service.git
```

## Go to the application root folder (run in terminal from the original folder where the repo was cloned):
```
cd nodejs2024Q3-service
```

## Switch to task branch:

```
git checkout task_part3
```

## Installing NPM modules

```
npm install
```

## If you encounter problems during npm installation:

```
npm install --force
```

## Create env file (.env is moved to .gitignore)

Create `.env` file (**based** on `.env.example`)

OR YOU CAN JUST RENAME `.env.example` to `.env`

## Docker

Make sure docker is installed on your system:
- download Docker
- install Docker
- start Docker
- log in to [_Docker hub_](https://hub.docker.com/)


## Building images
1. To build images locally, firstly check that all previously started containers are stopped (port 4000 is free)
2. Run:
```
npm run docker:build
```
3. The app needs some time to start inside the docker container. Wait until container will finish starting process and Nest will complete starting compilation (if you run the tests right away, they will fail). Check docker container starting log in Docker desktop application (usually the startup time does not exceed 30 seconds after the image is created).
4. Start tests

## Tests
If you completed installing of the dependencies, pulling or building the images, and containers are started (docker log of started container is ok), open **NEW** terminal and run:
```
npm run test:auth
```

## Stop running container
To stop running container and delete it:
```
npm run docker:down
```

## Stop running container and delete volumes and images
### !!! IMPORTANT !!!
To stop running container and delete ALL volumes and images in your system:
```
npm run docker:clean
```
